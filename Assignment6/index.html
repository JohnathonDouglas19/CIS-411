			<h1> What is Node.js?</h1>
			<p>In the following section we discuss what Node.js is and why its better than traditional server side languages.  </p>

				<h3>A little about Node.js</h3>
				<p>Node.js is an open source cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications.   Node.js is not a JavaScript framework but allows for new modules to be written in JavaScript.  Ryan Dahl created Node.js after noticing that a file that was being uploaded had to query the web serve in order to know how much had been uploaded.  Node.js is used to write web programs making it very similar to PHP. </p>

				<h3>Why use Node.js</h3>
				<p>Node is a unique framework because it brings event-driven programming to web servers.  This enables the fast development of servers in JavaScript, which allows developers to create highly scalable serves without using threading.  Node.js was created because concurrency is difficult in many server-side programming languages, and often leads to poor performance.  </p>

				<h3>Features of Node.js</h3>
				<p>Node.js opens a new way of performing web requests different than any other type of server requests called Non-blocking IO Operation.  Node scales well for I/O intensive requests and allows many users to be connected simultaneously. It is single threaded, so it doesn't necessarily scale well for CPU intensive tasks.  In node.js environment, the performing operation is executed by one object and the results of the operation are handled by the callback functions.  This is called non blocking and is one of the main features of Node.js.  This non blocking I/O is what makes node.js one of the better web frameworks to use.  </p>
